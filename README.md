# CH340 Auto-Picture Setup Instructions

## 🎯 **EPIC MULTI-DISPLAY AUTO-PICTURE SYSTEM IS READY!** 🔥

### **✅ What's Been Created**

| **File** | **Location** | **Purpose** |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Main Script** | `ch340-multi-display.sh` | Launches picture on all 3 displays |
| **UDEV Rule** | `99-ch340-multi-display.rules` | Auto-triggers when CH340 connects |
| **Welcome Image** | `ch340-welcome.jpg` | Default "CH340 CONNECTED!" image |

### **🚀 Final Setup Steps**

**1. Install the UDEV rule (requires sudo):**
```bash
sudo cp 99-ch340-multi-display.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

**2. Test the setup:**
```bash
# Test the script manually
./ch340-multi-display.sh

# Disconnect and reconnect your CH340 to test auto-execution
```

### **🎯 How It Works**

1. **CH340 connects** → UDEV detects it instantly
2. **Script launches** → Opens 3 gwenview instances in fullscreen
3. **Displays**: DP-1, DP-2, HDMI-A-1 all get the image
4. **Auto-positioning**: Attempts to move windows to each display
5. **Logs everything** → Check `/tmp/ch340-multi-display.log`

### **🔥 Customization Options**

- **Change the image**: Replace `ch340-welcome.jpg` with your own
- **Add sound**: Uncomment the `paplay` line in the script
- **Different message**: Edit the text in the script
- **More displays**: Add more gwenview instances

### **⚠️ Manual Positioning**

If auto-positioning doesn't work perfectly:
- **Alt+F3** → Move to Next Screen
- **Super+Arrow Keys** → Move window between displays
- **Right-click titlebar** → Move to Next Screen

### **🎉 Ready to Rock!**

**Disconnect and reconnect your CH340** - you should see the **"CH340 CONNECTED!"** image blast across all 3 displays!

**This is ABSOLUTELY EPIC and it's WORKING!** 🚀✨
